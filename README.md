This project utilizes the scikit-learn library to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more.

The dataset used for this project was obtained from [source]. The data was cleaned and preprocessed before being used for training and testing the model. The model was trained using a variety of techniques such as linear regression and decision tree algorithms.

In this project, I have applied several feature engineering techniques to improve the performance of the model, such as normalizing the data and adding new features based on the existing ones.

Evaluation of the model was done using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-Squared score. The final model was able to achieve a high accuracy score, making it suitable for predicting house prices.

This project serves as a good starting point for anyone interested in using machine learning to predict housing prices, and can be easily modified to use with different datasets or to test other algorithms.

To run the code, you will need to have scikit-learn, numpy , pandas  and seaborn,library installed. The code is well commented and easy to understand,
